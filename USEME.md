GUI Tutorial:

1) Click the "Load Image" button and select an image from your file explorer
to use, then enter a name for your image and click "Confirm". Alternatively, 
you can choose a default image already loaded in by opening the dropdown box 
and selecting one.
2) Select the corresponding button on the left side of the screen that represents
which operation you want to run on the image that is currently selected. 
3) Selecting the "Red Greyscale", "Green Greyscale", "BlueGreyscale", "Max-Value 
Greyscale", "Luma Greyscale", "Intensity Greyscale", "Sepia Tone", "Horizontal
Flip", "Vertical Flip", "Blur Filter", and "Sharpen Filter" buttons will prompt you 
to enter a name for the new image, while the "Brighten" button will ask for
a number to brighten the image by, as well as a name.
4) The new image will be displayed. From here, you can continue modifying this image, 
select another image already loaded in from the dropdown button, load in a new image,
or save the image currently being displayed.
